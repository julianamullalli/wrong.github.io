        <p class="lead mb-4"> My job consists of drawing blood from individuals in need of blood tests. My scope of practice is limited to the procedure itself, so I am unable to tell patients what the tests are for. I receive orders from a physician and collect the proper testing tubes as well as follow an order of draw to prevent contamination due to additives. This job allows me to get some clinical experience before I get my bachelors degree, as well as bringing me into a new side of medical care. This is my first experience working directly with patients and performing somewhat invasive actions. I have learned a lot about bedside manners and just the overall patient and clinician interaction. 
I work part time because I am a full time student at UC Riverside. I spend most of my time studying for upcoming exams and keeping up with school work. Because I am looking to go to med school, I have a private tutor that I meet up with twice a week to ensure I am understanding the MCAT material. As a psychology major, I miss out on a lot of biology,physics, etc. making it crucial for me to look for outside sources of information i.e. my tutor. I just transferred here this year from a community college, so I am excited to engage in a more rigorous academic setting. This will only make me more confident when it comes to applying for and attending medical school in the future. 
  <br><br>

        

I am looking to become a Psychiatrist in the future. Due to limited opportunities in psychology as an undergraduate student, I have had to look extra hard for job experiences relevant to my field. I have previously worked as a behavioral technician, or someone who applies ABA therapy with children with autism. I thoroughly enjoyed working with students and applying therapy techniques given to me by a psychologist. I worked in a classroom setting with 10 students where I aided teachers and other behavioral technicians in teaching students as well as trying to change maladaptive behaviors. I also conducted home therapy in a one on one setting. This job was extremely fulfilling and further encouraged me to go into psychiatry. 


<br><br>

        I have always wanted to work with children, which leads me to believe that I should be a children’s psychologist. I have worked with children for 6 years in various settings. I volunteered as a summer camp counselor for a volleyball camp for 4 years during my high school years. I was in charge of twenty students and their various activities for the day. I also volunteered at my school as a coach for our students with special needs. During this time I taught a multitude of sports. The goal was to improve dexterity and teamwork skills, as well as provide a safe environment for the students to engage in physical activities that neurotypical students were doing. I also tutored students in elementary school at my community college. I love improving the wellbeing of students and helping them become confident in their academic abilities.
